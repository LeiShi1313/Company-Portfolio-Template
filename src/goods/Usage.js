    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Usage is the manner in which written and spoken language is used, the "points of grammar, syntax, style, and the choice of words".[1] and "the way in which a word or phrase is normally and correctly used". Usage can mean the way people actually use language or prescriptively the way one group feels that people ought to use it.</p>
    <p>The Chicago Manual of Style says "the great mass of linguistic issues that writers and editors wrestle with don't really concern grammar at allâ€”they concern usage: the collective habits of a language's native speakers",[3] and "the standards of good usage change, however slowly.</p>
    <p>Dictionaries are not always accurate guides to "good usage." "Despite occasional usage notes, lexicographers generally disclaim any intent to guide writers and editors on the thorny points of English usage."</p>
