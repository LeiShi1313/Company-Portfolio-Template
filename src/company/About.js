        <p><strong>Build a trap for a leprechaun.</strong></p>
        <p>Because they are said to be little people, you could build a trap for a leprechaun out of a shoe box. Either way, choose something small.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a trap door in it. Or prop it up with a dowel that you glue to it.</li>
          <li>In addition to a shoebox, you could use anything small, such as a clean can, a paper towel roll, a bag, a net, or an old shoe. You could also put honey inside the trap so the leprechaun will get stuck inside the trap.</li>
          <li>Cut a hole in the top of the shoebox, and cover it with a small piece of felt. You will place your bait on top of the felt. When the leprechaun snatches it, the leprechaun will fall down the hole and into the box.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="col-md-6">
        <p><strong>Make a trap out of a cylinder.</strong></p>

        <p>You could use a cookie can or oatmeal cylindrical container instead, cover it in scrapbook paper, and prop a cardboard ladder up the side. If the leprechaun enters this vault, he wonâ€™t be able to get out.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put two holes in either side of the cylinder at the top and put a toothpick or other small stick through each end.</li>
          <li>Tape a perfect circle you make out of construction paper to the skewer. This will make a swinging trap door.</li>
